# Code Style and Formatting
## Pre-commit Hooks
Pre-commit hooks are useful for uniformly formatting code such as missing semicolons, removing trailing whitespace,
and standardizing line lengths. The goal is to allow the developer to focus on the code without getting bogged down in
trivial style nitpicks.

## Installation
_pip install pre-commit_

Run _pre-commit install_ to setup the git hook scripts. Now _pre-commit_ will run automatically on a _git commit_

Run _pip install pylint_ to install
